        <strong style="color: navy;">With Citation Smart, the City of Denton reported achieving a 72% case resolution within 45 days of the offense date.</strong><br><br>
        <p>Citation Smart sends defendants SMS and email reminders to handle their citations. Defendants can resolve their citations directly from their cell phones. By making it simple and easy to pay, this technology enables courts to boost collections and reduce defaults. 
        <br><br>
        Our software can also alert defendants who are at risk of being issued a warrant. This feature helps citizens avoid additional legal trouble and ensures that courts do not have to devote excessive time and resources to securing a payment.
        <br><br>
        Citation Smart easily integrates with existing court management software, facilitating ease of use, real-time reports, and smart data storage.

## Online Dispute Resolution (ODR)

Courts On The Go offers a digital platform to help courts facilitate online dispute resolution. Using this mobile-friendly technology, courts can provide citizens with a convenient solution to request a deferred disposition, driver’s safety course, or payment plan, all options which can be shared via text message so that citizens can resolve citations in a timely manner without having to leave their homes.

The platform also facilitates document exchange, signatures, and communication between citizens and court officials. Our software provides a much more cost-effective and convenient alternative to mailing paper documents.

This platform allows courts to achieve a speedy resolution of citations, boost convenience for citizens and staff, and foster compliance.

## Virtual Court

<div class="flexbox-container">
    <div class="flex-child">
        <p>Our virtual court technology helps make your courtroom more accessible to all defendants and reduce FTAs (failures to appear) by those who cannot make it in person, which will ultimately save your court time and money.
        <br><br>
        This platform is a key resource for courts at every level -- state, county, municipal -- to ensure citizens can seamlessly resolve legal issues.
        <br><br>
        Virtual Court creates a layer over Zoom to efficiently coordinate and send out links for remote hearings.
        <br><br>
        Defendants can enter their driver’s license, citation number, or personal information to enter the waiting room. They can only enter the virtual courtroom if they are on the docket and the court staff lets them in.
        <br><br>
        Courts can electronically send and receive documents through the virtual court interface.
        <br><br>
        Virtual Court seamlessly integrates with your court management software to ensure a smooth workflow during each hearing. Through our interface, you can directly handle defendant engagement, exchange documents, and update the case status.

## Payment Kiosks

<div class="flexbox-container">
    <div class="flex-child">
        <p>Defendants can use a kiosk to pay their fines and tickets. Our bilingual kiosk works around the clock, providing an easy solution to make in-person payments using cash, check, or credit card. 
        <br><br>
        Many courts decide to piggyback on utilities department funds to acquire a kiosk that serves both departments' needs.
