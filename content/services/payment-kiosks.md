<h3>Secure transactions and consistent monitoring</h3>
<p>Payments through the kiosk are encrypted and PCI compliant to maintain industry-leading security. AdComp routinely monitors all payment kiosks to immediately identify and resolve any technical or security-related issues.</p>
<h3>Payment receipts boost customer confidence</h3>
<p>Residents can conveniently look up their account and payment information through JACK to quickly pay their bills. Residents also get email, text, or printed receipts at the end of a transaction so they have proof of a successful payment.</p>
<h3>Quick payment posting</h3>
<p>All payments through our self-service kiosk are automatically posted to the relevant government department to avoid any delay in revenue collection. The kiosk machine is also a more secure, smart and hassle-free alternative to the regular payment dropbox.</p>
